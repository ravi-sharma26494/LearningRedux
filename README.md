### REACT REDUX


## Redux: Single store, CDS
## Reducers: Manage state and return newly updated state
## Actions: 2 properties:
            i. Type: unique itentifier
            ii. Payload: which has data
## Dispatch: Send actions to update the data
## useSelector:    A hook to access the redux store's state. 
                This hook takes a selector function as an argument.
                The selector is called with the store state.


### Building the same thing(Counter Application) with redux toolkit
    # In src> index.js- we will create a store with redux toolkit
    . import configure store from redux toolkit
    
    . create a slice(createSlice({.... inside it ðŸ”½}))
        slice has the name , initial state, reducer function
        these reduer functions has the all the functionaly, that we wen at to implement with the state, incement, decrement etc.
    â–¶ Now you have to export the store + actions seperately
        export const actions = counterSlice.actions;
        const store = configureStore({
        reducer:counterSlice.reducer
        });
        export default store;

    
    â–¶ Now in main file / app.js import the above created actions
        import {actions } from './src/store/index.js';
        for each methods: instead of passing the dispatch type: we can just dispatch actions or the functions / reducer functions:

        so now => const increment = ()=>{
            dispatch(actions.increment())
        }

        previously it was =>
            const inscrement = ()=>{
                dispacth({
                    type="Inc"
                })
            }
