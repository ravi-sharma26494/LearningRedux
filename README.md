### REACT REDUX


## Redux: Single store, CDS
## Reducers: Manage state and return newly updated state
## Actions: 2 properties:
            i. Type: unique itentifier
            ii. Payload: which has data
## Dispatch: Send actions to update the data
## useSelector:    A hook to access the redux store's state. 
                This hook takes a selector function as an argument.
                The selector is called with the store state.

## A. Building a Counter Application, with Redux
    (a.) [ Libararies needed ]:
        i. npm i redux
        ii. npm i react-redux
    ## (b.) create a folder store in src, inside it create a file index.js
           -> Here we will handle all of our states(i.e increment, decrement, increment by value) in this single file,
            which is our single store.(Or single source of states).
        (i.) in index.js(above file)- 
                import createStore from redux, import {createStore} from "redux;
                create a reducer function with state and action as parameters, const reducerFn = (state, action)=>{}
                create a store variable and assign it to create store function const store = createStore();
                initialise the state with default property of counter with value 0, and return the state;
                provide the reducerFn to the createStore(); createStore(reducerFn);
                export the store; export deafault store;
        (ii) in the root index.js of the app:
               - import the provider from react-redux, this provider will have a property called the store which will
                hold our store, and this store will be like a context, which will be available to whole of our app
                so you have to wrap the whole app with provider;
                your index.js(root) will have these lines now
                    import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
                    import store from './store/index';
                wrapping the whole app with store,
                        <Provider store={store}>
                            <React.StrictMode>
                                <App />
                            </React.StrictMode>
                        </Provider>
        (iii) In App.js, we will create our counter Application
                - we have create a store in the src> store > index.js, our app can access the state with the help
                  of useSelector Hook, import it in app.js.
                - create increment and decrement buttons with respective increment and decrement functions, onClick
                - these function will not directly handle the state(add or decrement the counter), they will just Dispatch an action, which will be
                    increment or decrement.
                - to Dispatch any action you need a dispatcher function, which will be provide by useDispatch hook of react-redux,
                  so import it import {useDispatch} from 'react-redux'
                - now since it is a hook, you need to store it into a variable to use it: i.e const dispatch = useDispatch();
                - this dispatch variable has an object with the type, and paylod properties
                    type: 'Inc' , for incrementing the value, so the increment function will look like this: 
                        const increment = ()=>{
                            dispatch({
                                type: 'Inc'
                            });
                        }
                - Now the actual incrementing or decrementing is done in the store only by reducerFn, the app(component) only dispatch(or tells the reducerfn)
                    What it should do? Like: Hey Reducer Function I am dispatching and action with the type 'Inc', if you see it
                    increase the counter by 1.
                .NOTE: Reducer Functions have some limitations:
                    (a.) They are (should be) Synchronous functions, it should not contain an async code inside it
                    (b.) We should never mutate the original state, it should always be a copy of the original state. Main sate should never be updated
                - Now in the store file (src>store>index.js)
                    1. Check what is the type of the action, if it is 'INC', return the counter property of the store by incrementing it by one 
                     if(action.type === 'INC'){
                        return{ counter: state.counter + 1 }
                     }
                     Repeat the same for decrement.

### Ding the same thing with redux toolkit
    # In src> index.js- we will create a store with redux toolkit
    . import configure store from redux toolkit
    
    . create a slice(createSlice({.... inside it ðŸ”½}))
        slice has the name , initial state, reducer function
        these reduer functions has the all the functionaly, that we wen at to implement with the state, incement, decrement etc.
    â–¶ Now you have to export the store + actions seperately
        export const actions = counterSlice.actions;
        const store = configureStore({
        reducer:counterSlice.reducer
        });
        export default store;

    
    â–¶ Now in main file / app.js import the above created actions
        import {actions } from './src/store/index.js';
        for each methods: instead of passing the dispatch type: we can just dispatch actions or the functions / reducer functions:

        so now => const increment = ()=>{
            dispatch(actions.increment())
        }

        previously it was =>
            const inscrement = ()=>{
                dispacth({
                    type="Inc"
                })
            }
